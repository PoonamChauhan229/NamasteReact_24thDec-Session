Now created a src folder.

Every project we have src folder:
Why it is needed?
We can do it an 1 folder as well but we need to wrap it into 1 proper folder structure.

Sometimes our app goes big so it becomes difficult to manage
So  for file organization we need to create it

All our files related to project, we will keep it into it.
