Now created a src folder.

Every project we have src folder:
Why it is needed?
We can do it an 1 folder as well but we need to wrap it into 1 proper folder structure.

Sometimes our app goes big so it becomes difficult to manage
So  for file organization we need to create it

All our files related to project, we will keep it into it.


import and export

Now create config.js

Put all the hard coded file in contants.js

Made the code clear by putting them in seperate files.


With the below input box, its not possible to type anything in the input box

and if the same thing is written in index.html then it working fine as per the nature of input box.

React input is not exactly the HTML input box.

inputbox written in React is somehow controlled by the React itself.

So how it will work?

REact follows 1 way databinding.

so if we want to edit it ,
we have to use onchange method

When you change something, react rerenders it but it wont show 

React maintains the state.

Usestate:
to create state varibles
 returns an array , ist is the variablename
SearchText is a local state variable
[variablename,function to update the variable]=return array

Why do we need react variable, if we have a normal variable

let constant =10;
somebody updated this variable, REact will not know when i have updated.
React wont know i have to change it in UI
