BUNDLERS:
Most React apps will have their files “bundled” using tools like Webpack, Rollup or Browserify.

BUNDLERS are used to minify the code,optimize the code

parsel is a BUNDLERS but it is known as package

package is like a module.(some peice of code)
so we need a package manager

npm /yarn -use for package manager

NPM?
NPM doesnt stand for node package manager.

https://www.npmjs.com/
NPM official website and no where its written it stand node package manager.

even they troll on the website itself ... keep clicking on it

SO now how to npm in our project

npm init
==npm initialize

npm init-y

when we have pacakage manager , let us ignite our apps
using parcel
https://parceljs.org/

npm install parcel

We dont want parcel on developer machine not on the production machine

npm install -D parcel
-D=> dev dependencies
--save-dev

dependencies is all the packages which our project needs.
my project is dependent on something that is a dev dependencies
parcel is one of such dependencies 
dev dependencies means we need parcel in the developement environment.

Now , why 2 files 

tilde(~) and caret(^) in package.json beside version

Read:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22343224/whats-the-difference-between-tilde-and-caret-in-package-json

caret(^) => automatically upgrade to minor version
tilde(~) => automatically upgrade to major version

Why we need pacakage-lock.json?
pacakage-lock.json locks the version of it and keep it safe.
it keeps a snapshot of what your system has.
it is very important file
it locks the version and you never have to keep it in gitignore
maintains the exact version of it and hash  as well, this hash ensures what version of parcel was running in my system is exactly the same on production so it maintains the integrity.

by default node modules, installed, what is this
whenever we install anything it get installed in node modules.
so node modules is like a database for npm
from here the super powers are coming from

how will parcel minify the code?
parcel will use something minifier form node modules
so parcel will use these helpers and optimize our code in production.


you dont have to put node modules on the repository , it is the haeaviest one.
it is foolish to do so.

Why we dont put it in git 
because our node modules has sufficient information to recreate the nodemodules.
we can generate everything in node modules , if i have my pacakage.json and pacakage-lock.json
if i have both the files, i can regenerate however heavy nodemodules is because nodemodules keep a track of all the dependencies.

we will not push node modules , we will generate 
1:08:24

npm i react
npm i react-dom

Now let us ignite our app with parcel.

npx parcel entrypoint
npx parcel index.html
x stands for execution.
npx means execute using npm

Uncaught ReferenceError: React is not defined
    at App.js:1:16

This error will come.
i want to use something which is there in nodemodules
so i have to import it

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

Still it wont work, and it gives an ugly error
@parcel/transformer-js: Browser scripts cannot have imports or exports.


never touc nodemodules and package-lock.json
Wyy this error?
because Browser understand its an normal js file
so we have to say that its not an normal file.
so add type="module" in the script tag.
and 
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';


Parcel:
Production ready app then=>

HMR-Hot Module Replacement=>it tracks for every change
File Watcher algorithm written in C++ =>it tracks for every change and tels the server to Reloading
BUNDLing
minify
Cleaning our Code=>removes console.log
dev and production build
super fast build alogorithm
image optimization
caching while developement
compression
compatible with older version of Browser
https on dev =>npx parcel build index.html --https
port no
consistent hashing algorithm
zero config
Transitive dependencies
This is known as transitive dependencies.

We have 1 pacakage manager which handles transitive dependencies





When i have to tell the parcel to make the production  build 
how do i tell parcel
npx parcel build index.html

and  it will build inside the dist folder


It should works on older browsers=>browserslist

"browserslist": [
    "last 2 versions"
  ]
