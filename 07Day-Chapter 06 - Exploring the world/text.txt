Microservices Architecture:
Instead of having just 1 project, now we have small small different projects 
UI project
Backend API project
Notification project
Logs project
Authentication project
etc

Everything can be hosted on different ports and that is why we have different ports

Advantages:
Major one:
Easier to test
SOC(Seperation of Concern)=> No need to worry about other project
